issues:
	spelling mistake: "percipitation"
	precipitation =/= rain + snow/ice
	date not sorted
	number of stations in use not constant
	staions phase in and out
	missingness in "CATTARAUGUS CO OLEAN" and "CATTARAUGUS COUNTY OLEAN AIRPORT" dovetails!
	same location under the different names: 
		CATTARAUGUS CO OLEAN => CATTARAUGUS COUNTY OLEAN AIRPORT
		FLOYD BENNETT MEM => FLOYD BENNETT MEM => FLOYD BENNETT MEMO AIRPORT
		LONG ISLAND MAC ART => LONG ISLAND MAC ART => LONG ISLAND MAC ARTHUR AIRPORT
		CENTRAL PARK => NEW YORK CENTRAL PARK => NYC CENTRAL PARK
	similar locations replacing old station:
		OGDENSBURG => OGDENSBURG INTL 
		THE BATTERY => PORT AUTH DOWNTN MANHATTAN WALL ST HEL
	different stations bearing the same/similar names: 
		ROCHESTER & ROCHESTER
		MONTAUK & MONTAUK AIRPORT 


ideas: 
	interaction between population size and weather
	spatial-temporal drifts in weather conditions -- would matrix completion work??
	missingness could inform number of calls?
